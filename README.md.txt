hi, thanks for picking up the mod!
this mod includes the restored & improved rhythm game editor in DELTARUNE Chapter 4 and the custom Black Knife chart.

how to install:
- using the Delta Patcher (DeltaPatcher.exe), patch your Chapter 4 data.win file using the rhythm_editor.xdelta file.
	(it is reccommended to BACKUP your original data.win file.)
	(by selecting the backup original file option, the patch will be saved to dataPATCHED.win instead. rename the file to data.win.)
- drag every *.txt file (except for this one) into your save directory
- create a save file with the dark world flag enabled that loads into either of the following:
	- room_rhythmgame_editor (access to the full chart editor and auto mode)
	- room_dw_rhythm_countdown (access to the track select and hard mode)
- it is NOT reccommended to load into any of the following:
	- room_dw_rhythm (unaccounted for; will very very very likely crash)
	- room_dw_castle_tv_rhythm (barely works, sends you to the track select anyway)
- open DELTARUNE and load said save file

custom songs can be created, modified and deleted via the chart editor
vanilla song list can be restored by deleting songlist.txt
glhf, and happy charting!

PS. original snippets of the vanilla rhythm minigame
(scores & ranks and the minigame room in castle town)
have been heavily modified for the sake of customizability
